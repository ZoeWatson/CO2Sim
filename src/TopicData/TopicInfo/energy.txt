Info: Energy Needs, how we get energy. 
Fusion research 
Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018 and in a business as usual scenario, by 2040 global energy consumption will reach 740 million terajoules - equivalent to an additional 30 percent growth. 
Energy need : 580 million terajoules.
non renable  -> runs out 
renweable -> how much can we biuld? land? materials? relaiblity

what's being used where -> exporting co2

// info 
since wind is not locally predictable in the short term, the use of wind energy should be limited to only fulfill 5 - 15% of the total energy demand of the area [3]

// Coal Range
"World coal reserves in 2020 are 1.07 trillion tonnes" https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coal-proved-reserves
There are 8141 KWH in 1 tonnes of coal
(1.07 trillion * 8760 *10^-6 )/100 = 8.7 *10^13 =  tWh as a rough max

// Wind Range
2% of the solar energy absorbed by the Earth goes into wind [3].
35% of the energy (2.45 W/m2) dissipating in the first kilometre above Earth's surface

* times a year to get twh
196697600 *(2/100)*(35/100) *(2/3)* 8760 = 8,040,997,888 tWh

* this is a therorectial limit 
The reseach hasn't been done to realy figure out the practicle limit of reneable energy sources. the therotical limit is very high
but the limts of space, good area, and materials are very real.
